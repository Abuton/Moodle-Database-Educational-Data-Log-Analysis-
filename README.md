# Moodle-Database-Educational-Data-Log-Analysis</p>

<p>10 Academy, like any other educational facility, is interested to understand the learners skill and knowledge development, and is interested to build models that are able to predict possible dropouts as well as classify learners into doing, well, doing ok, and struggling groups. 10 Academy is also interested in automating the process of reminding learners approaching deadlines, providing quick feedback based on their overall community engagement and performance. Moreover, given the main goal of 10 Academy training is to make students job ready, it wants to measure students' performance across many relevant metrics.

<p> assuming a role-model of a freelancer hired by 10 Academy, you are to explore the 10 Academy Moodle logs stored in the database together with many other relevant tables.
